## Summary

Solidus is a complete open source ecommerce solution built with Ruby on Rails.
It is a fork of [Spree](https://spreecommerce.org).

See the [Solidus class documentation](http://docs.solidus.io) and the [Solidus
Guides](https://guides.solidus.io) for information about the functionality that
Solidus provides.

Solidus consists of several gems. When you require the `solidus` gem in your
`Gemfile`, Bundler will install all of the following gems:

- [`solidus_api`](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/tree/master/api) (RESTful API)
- [`solidus_backend`](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/tree/master/backend) (Admin area)
- [`solidus_core`](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/tree/master/core) (Essential models, mailers, and classes)
- [`solidus_sample`](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/tree/master/sample) (Sample data)

All of the gems are designed to work together to provide a fully functional
ecommerce platform. However, you may only want to use the
[`solidus_core`](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/tree/master/core) gem
combine it with your own custom frontend, admin interface, and API.

## Demo

You can try the live Solidus demo [here.](http://demo.solidus.io/) The admin section can be accessed [here.](http://demo.solidus.io/admin)

## Getting started

Begin by making sure you have
[Imagemagick](http://imagemagick.org/script/download.php) installed, which is
required for Paperclip. (You can install it using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) if
you're on a Mac.)

To add Solidus, begin with a newly created Rails application with its database.

```bash
rails new my_store
```

### Installing Solidus

In your application's root folder run:

```bash
bundle add solidus
bin/rails g solidus:install
```

And follow the prompt's instructions.
### Accessing Solidus Store

Start the Rails server with the command:

```bash
bin/rails s
```

The storefront will be accessible at
[http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) and the admin can be found at
[http://localhost:3000/admin/](http://localhost:3000/admin/).

For information on how to customize your store, check out the [customization guides](https://guides.solidus.io/developers/customizations/overview.html).

### Default Username/Password

As part of running the above installation steps, you will be asked to set an admin email/password combination. The default values are `admin@example.com` and `test123`, respectively.

### Questions?

The best way to ask questions is to [join the Solidus Slack](http://slack.solidus.io/) and join the [#support channel](https://solidusio.slack.com/messages/support/details/).

## Installation options

Instead of a stable build, if you want to use the bleeding edge version of
Solidus, use this line:

```ruby
gem 'solidus', github: 'solidusio/solidus'
```

**Note: The master branch is not guaranteed to ever be in a fully functioning
state. It is too risky to use this branch in production.**

By default, the installation generator (`solidus:install`) will run
migrations as well as adding seed and sample data. This can be disabled using

```bash
bin/rails g solidus:install --migrate=false --sample=false --seed=false
```

You can always perform any of these steps later by using these commands.

```bash
bin/rails railties:install:migrations
bin/rails db:migrate
bin/rails db:seed
bin/rails spree_sample:load
```

There are also options and rake tasks provided by
[solidus\_auth\_devise](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus_auth_devise).

## Performance

You may notice that your Solidus store runs slowly in development mode. This
can be because in development each CSS and JavaScript is loaded as a separate
include. This can be disabled by adding the following to
`config/environments/development.rb`.

```ruby
config.assets.debug = false
```

### Turbolinks

To gain some extra speed you may enable Turbolinks inside of Solidus admin.

Add `gem 'turbolinks', '~> 5.0.0'` into your `Gemfile` (if not already present)
and change `vendor/assets/javascripts/spree/backend/all.js` as follows:

```js
//= require turbolinks
//
// ... current file content
//
//= require spree/backend/turbolinks-integration.js
```

**CAUTION** Please be aware that Turbolinks can break extensions
and/or customizations to the Solidus admin. Use at your own risk.

## Developing Solidus

* Clone the Git repo

  ```bash
  git clone git://github.com/solidusio/solidus.git
  cd solidus
  ```

### Without Docker

* Install the gem dependencies

  ```bash
  bin/setup
  ```

  _Note_: If you're using PostgreSQL or MySQL, you'll need to install those gems through the DB environment variable.

  ```bash
  # PostgreSQL
  export DB=postgresql
  bin/setup

  # MySQL
  export DB=mysql
  bin/setup
  ```

### With Docker

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

Wait for all the gems to be installed (progress can be checked through `docker-compose logs -f app`).

You can provide the ruby version you want your image to use:

```bash
docker-compose build --build-arg RUBY_VERSION=3.0 app
docker-compose up -d
```

The rails version can be customized at runtime through `RAILS_VERSION` environment variable:

```bash
RAILS_VERSION='~> 5.0' docker-compose up -d
```

Running tests:

```bash
# sqlite
docker-compose exec app bin/rspec
# postgres
docker-compose exec app env DB=postgres bin/rspec
# mysql
docker-compose exec app env DB=mysql bin/rspec
```

Accessing the databases:

```bash
# sqlite
docker-compose exec app sqlite3 /path/to/db
# postgres
docker-compose exec app env PGPASSWORD=password psql -U root -h postgres
# mysql
docker-compose exec app mysql -u root -h mysql -ppassword
```

In order to be able to access the [sandbox application](#sandbox), just make
sure to provide the appropriate `--binding` option to `rails server`. By
default, port `3000` is exposed, but you can change it through `SANDBOX_PORT`
environment variable:

```bash
SANDBOX_PORT=4000 docker-compose up -d
docker-compose exec app bin/sandbox
docker-compose exec app bin/rails server --binding 0.0.0.0 --port 4000
```

### Sandbox

Solidus is meant to be run within the context of Rails application. You can
easily create a sandbox application inside of your cloned source directory for
testing purposes.

This sandbox includes solidus\_auth\_devise and generates with seed and sample
data already loaded.

* Create the sandbox application

  ```bash
  bin/sandbox
  ```

  You can create a sandbox with PostgreSQL or MySQL by setting the DB environment variable.

  ```bash
  # PostgreSQL
  export DB=postgresql
  bin/sandbox

  # MySQL
  export DB=mysql
  bin/sandbox
  ```

  Depending on your local environment, it may be necessary for you to set environment variables for your RDBMS, namely:
    - `DB_HOST`
    - `DB_USER`
    - `DB_PASSWORD`

  If you need to create a Rails 5.2 application for your sandbox, for example
  if you are still using Ruby 2.4 which is not supported by Rails 6, you can
  use the `RAILS_VERSION` environment variable.

  ```bash
    export RAILS_VERSION='~> 5.2.0'
    bin/setup
    bin/sandbox
  ```

* Start the server (`bin/rails` will forward any argument to the sandbox)

  ```bash
  bin/rails server
  ```

### Tests

Solidus uses [RSpec](http://rspec.info) for tests. Refer to its documentation for
more information about the testing library.

#### CircleCI

We use CircleCI to run the tests for Solidus as well as all incoming pull
requests. All pull requests must pass to be merged.

You can see the build statuses at
[https://circleci.com/gh/solidusio/solidus](https://circleci.com/gh/solidusio/solidus).

#### Run all tests

[ChromeDriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads) is required to run
the backend test suites.

To execute all of the test specs, run the `bin/build` script at the root of the Solidus project:

```bash
createuser --superuser --echo postgres # only the first time
bin/build
```

The `bin/build` script runs using PostgreSQL by default, but it can be overridden by setting the DB environment variable to `DB=sqlite` or `DB=mysql`. For example:

```bash
env DB=mysql bin/build
```

If the command fails with MySQL related errors you can try creating a user with this command:

```bash
# Creates a user with the same name as the current user and no restrictions.
mysql --user="root" --execute="CREATE USER '$USER'@'localhost'; GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON * . * TO '$USER'@'localhost';"
```

#### Run an individual test suite

Each gem contains its own series of tests. To run the tests for the core project:

```bash
cd core
bundle exec rspec
```

By default, `rspec` runs the tests for SQLite 3. If you would like to run specs
against another database you may specify the database in the command:

```bash
env DB=postgresql bundle exec rspec
```

#### Code coverage reports

If you want to run the [SimpleCov](https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov) code
coverage report:

```bash
COVERAGE=true bundle exec rspec
```

### Extensions

In addition to core functionality provided in Solidus, there are a number of
ways to add features to your store that are not (or not yet) part of the core
project.

A list can be found at [extensions.solidus.io](http://extensions.solidus.io/).

If you want to write an extension for Solidus, you can use the
[solidus_dev_support](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus_dev_support.git) gem.
